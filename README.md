packer-templates
================

Packer templates used to build base box images at the OSL for OpenStack and
Ganeti.

The target architectures are:

* x86_64
* aarch64
* ppc64
* ppc64le

To build an image for use on OpenStack, run `bin/build_image.sh` with the
relevant options. Make sure your `scripts` and kickstart configuration files
served by Packer's `http` server are available in the right place in this repo.
